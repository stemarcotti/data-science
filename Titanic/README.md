[Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) - Intro to ML Prediction

### Data
Train and test data can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and should be saved in local folder called [Data]

### Source code
[titanic.ipynb](titanic.ipynb) contains the Jupyter notebook code to train a random forest classifier predicting which passenger survived the shipwreck.    
The instructions suggested that some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.   
Therefore, features connected to these characteristics were selected to train the classifier.   

Some of the provided tutorials/discussion posts on Kaggle were used as reference.
